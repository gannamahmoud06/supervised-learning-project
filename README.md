# supervised-learning-project
This repository contains two separate machine learning tasks that demonstrate skills in **data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization**.  
Each notebook is self-contained and focuses on a different type of ML problem.

## ðŸ“Œ Project 1: House Price Prediction (Regression)
- **Dataset**: Advanced house pricing dataset.  
- **Goal**: Predict house prices based on various numerical and categorical features.  
- **Techniques used**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features).
  - Feature scaling and transformation.
  - Models: Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge regression.
  - Model evaluation with metrics: RMSE, MAE, RÂ².
- **Outcome**: Insights into the most important features affecting housing prices and a well-tuned regression model for predictions.

## ðŸ“Œ Project 2: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic (Classification)
- **Dataset**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset (binary classification: malignant vs. benign).  
- **Goal**: Build a classification model to detect breast cancer based on diagnostic features.  
- **Techniques used**:
  - Data preprocessing and scaling.
  - Logistic Regression with L2 regularization.
  - Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
- **Outcome**: A robust classification model to assist in early detection of breast cancer.
